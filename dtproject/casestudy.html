  <p>Healthy weight gain and weight management</p>
  <p>Felicity was in her 70’s, living on her own and had recently undergone surgery. Her ill-health and lack of energy had caused her to lose
    interest in cooking, lose weight and subsequently, to lose interest in life in general. Lynda’s aim was to help Felicity regain weight
    through eating the right foods with simple and healthy meal options which were easy to prepare on her own.</p>
  <p>Felicity was initially resistant to change, but by showing her some easy ideas and recipes, she gradually regained healthy weight – and
    her zest for life.</p>

  <p>Sarah came to see Lynda pre-conception to learn about an optimum diet to support a healthy pregnancy. She lost 3kgs of fat as planned
    prior to becoming pregnant and continued to see Lynda throughout her pregnancy to ensure a healthy diet for her and her baby. </p>
  <p>Sarah’s goal was not to avoid gaining excess fat, but to have a healthy pregnancy and ensure her baby was receiving the best nutritional
    benefits possible. </p>
  <p>Sarah remained well during her pregnancy and gained only a healthy amount of weight. Six weeks after her baby was born, Sarah 
    visited Lynda again to ensure she was eating the right foods – and eating enough – whilst breastfeeding.
    
    “I was very apprehensive about getting fat while I was pregnant but with Lynda’s advice I didn’t gain excess fat and loved the healthy
     food I was eating.”</p>

    <p>Cole is a water skier who wanted to optimise his performance for competing in the World Championships. He is also a full-time
        University student, works 30 hours a week during term time and full-time during the holidays – and fits training 5-6 days per week
        around this.
       </p>
    <p>Sarah’s goal was not to avoid gaining excess fat, but to have a healthy pregnancy and ensure her baby was receiving the best nutritional
      benefits possible. </p>
    <p>When Cole came to see Lynda, his goal was to lose 6kgs by the time competition day came. But with such a demanding schedule, he 
        was struggling to find the energy needed to cope with the stresses of work, study and training in order to perform at his best.
        Through a healthy diet tailored to suit the demands of his lifestyle and training, Cole dropped 6.7kgs, increased his energy levels and
         even found he no longer needed his asthma inhaler
    </p>
    <p>“I would never have been able to keep up with my incredibly demanding schedule if I hadn’t got on board with better nutrition.”

        “Through your help and advice I never faulted in my aim to put some weight on and today I struck gold – I reached 50.2kgs!…Many thanks for helping me to find her energy and enjoy life again”.</p>
