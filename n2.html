  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin A</td>
    <td>Found in potato, carrots, pumpkins, spinach, beef and eggs.
	</td>
    <td>Vitamin A helps form and maintain healthy teeth, bones, soft tissue, mucous membranes, and skin.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin C</td>
    <td>Found in citrus fruits and juices, such as oranges and grapefruits.</td>
    <td>Vitamin C, also called ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that promotes healthy teeth and gums. It helps the

  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin D</td>
    <td>Found in fortified milk and other dairy products.</td>
    <td>Vitamin D is also known as the "sunshine vitamin," since it is made by the body after being in the sun. Ten to 
		15 minutes of sunshine 
		3 times a week is enough to produce the body's requirement of vitamin D for most people at most latitudes. People who do not live 
		in sunny places may not make enough vitamin D. It is very hard to get enough vitamin D from food sources alone. Vitamin D helps the
		 body absorb calcium. You need calcium for the normal development and maintenance of healthy teeth and bones. It also helps
		 maintain proper blood levels of calcium and phosphorus.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin E</td>
    <td>Found in fortified cereals, leafy green vegetables, seeds, and nuts</td>
    <td>Vitamin E is an antioxidant also known as tocopherol. It helps the body form red blood cells and use
		vitamin K.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin K</td>
    <td>Found in dark green leafy vegetables and in turnip or beet green.</td>
    <td>Vitamin K is needed because without it, blood would not stick together (coagulate). Some studies suggest that
		it is important for bone health</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin B1 (thiamine)</td>
    <td>Found in pork chops, ham, enriched grains and seeds.</td>
    <td>Thiamine (vitamin B1) helps the body cells change carbohydrates into energy. Getting enough carbohydrates 
		is very important during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is also essential for heart function and healthy nerve cells.
		</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin B2 (riboflavin)</td>
    <td>Found in whole grains, enriched grains and dairy products.</td>
    <td>Riboflavin (vitamin B2) works with the other B vitamins. It is important for body growth and the production of 
		red blood cells.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin B3 (niacin)</td>
    <td>Found in mushrooms, fish, poultry, and whole grains.</td>
    <td>Niacin is a B vitamin that helps maintain healthy skin and nerves. It also has cholesterol-lowering effects at
		higher doses.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pantothenic acid (B5)</td>
    <td> Found in chicken, broccoli, legumes and whole grains</td>
    <td>Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is essential for the metabolism of food. It also plays a role in the production of
		hormones and cholesterol.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)</td>
    <td>Found in fortified cereals and soy products.</td>
    <td>Vitamin B6 is also called pyridoxine. Vitamin B6 helps form red blood cells and maintain brain function. This 
		vitamin also plays an
		 important role in the proteins that are part of many chemical reactions in the body. The more protein you eat the more pyridoxine 
		your body requires.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Biotin (B7)</td>
    <td> Found in many fruits like fruits and meats.</td>
    <td>Biotin is essential for the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, and in the production of hormones and 
		cholesterol.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Folate (folic acid or B9)</td>
    <td>Found in leafy vegetables.</td>
    <td>Folate works with vitamin B12 to help form red blood cells. It is needed for the production of DNA, which
		controls tissue growth and cell function. Any woman who is pregnant should be sure to get enough folate. Low levels of folate are
		linked to birth defects such as spina bifida. Many foods are now fortified with folate in the form of folic acid.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin)</td>
    <td>Found in fish, poultry, meat and dairy products.</td>
